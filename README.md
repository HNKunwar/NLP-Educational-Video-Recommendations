# NLP-Educational-Video-Recommendations [Flask Server]

Recommends educational videos based on a string of text by giving 9 videos with the highest similarity scores. For ex. text from a PDF/PPT page etc (meant to be for a concatenation of flashcards term definitions but will work for any text string). 

Currently only supports Math, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Economics, and (some) Computer Science since it pulls from a database curated for binary classification tasks and uses the Title, Description, & Subtitles for the comparison. (YTvideos.db)


* Get YTVideos.db and place into 'api' folder: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshukunwar/youtube-labeled-educational-videos
* Get GLoVe files here and do the same: https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe
## Usage/Examples

```

Run index.py to get recommendations in a JSON format with Title, Similarity, and Link fields.

Use test.py flask server to experiment locally. 
[glove.840B.300d.txt performs much better but slower - loads entire glove file into memory ~5 Gb]

### Example Input

```
What is the Pythagorean theorem? The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. How do you find the area of a circle? The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = Ï€r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.
```

### Example Output 
Structured by Test.py* 

Index.py gives JSON response in  Title, Similarity, Link format.
