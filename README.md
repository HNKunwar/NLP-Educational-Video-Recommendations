[![NLP Youtube Educational Videos Recommendations]

Recommends educational videos based on a string of text by giving 9 videos with the highest similarity scores. For ex. text from a PDF/PPT page etc (meant to be for a concatenation of flashcards term definitions but will work for any text string). 

Currently, it only supports Math, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Economics, and (some) Computer Science since it pulls from a database curated for binary classification tasks.


Note index.py returns in a JSON Title, Similarity, Link format. 
These are outputs structured by test.py
