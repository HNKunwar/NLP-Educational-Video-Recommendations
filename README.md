## Usage/Examples

```javascript

Run index.py to get recommendations in a JSON format with Title, Similarity, and Link fields.

Use test.py flask server to experiment locally. 
[glove.840B.300d.txt performs much better but slower]


```

### Example Input

```
What is the Pythagorean theorem? The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. How do you find the area of a circle? The area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = Ï€r^2, where A is the area and r is the radius of the circle.
```

### Example Output 
Structured by Test.py* 

Index.py gives JSON response in  Title, Similarity, Link format.
